# website_source_code

This is still under development and has many problems:

1. Content should to be filled.
2. All images should be automatically and appropriately cropped by python and resaved.
3. Given the google scholar page of all the supervisors, the code should automatically fetch recent publications of supervisors to update fetched_publications file. Let's write a automatic_main.py for that [a longer term goal].
